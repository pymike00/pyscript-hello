# pyscript-hello


### This is a basic example I wrote for my YouTube presentation and tutorial about PyScript.

<br>

### PyScript is a new framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), [WASM](https://webassembly.org/), and modern web technologies.

<br>

### How To:
- Download the repo
- Open the hello-pyscript.html file with Brave or Chrome
- Try new things, have fun and keep an eye for messages in the browser's developer console!

<br>

### Notes:
- If you wish to also use .py files you will need a dev server to avoid CORS errors
- You can spin a dev server with python3 using "python3 -m http.server" from within the examples folder
- On VS Code you can use the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey
